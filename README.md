# CorrDrugTumorMSI
A R package to correlate drug distribution with tumor tissue types in mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data. 

## Description
CorreDrugTumorMSI provides a complete analysis pipeline to analyze untargeted drug mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data. The main functionality of the package includes: preprocessing of MSI data, identified unsupervised clusters, create a drug spatial map, quantitative analysis of identified clusters and drug spatial map and selection of spatially relevant molecular ions from the identified clusters.
